However, the diff summary does not provide concrete evidence that the new flute audio file was actually added under `frontend/public/assets/audio/` (it is only referenced).",

      "reason": "The hook references `/assets/audio/soft-flute-background.mp3`, but the diff shows no added files, and no modification entry for `frontend/public/assets/audio/soft-flute-background.mp3`, so the presence of the actual audio asset cannot be verified from the diff summary.",
