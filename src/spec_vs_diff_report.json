  "summary": "Core Ask Big Sister app flow (II auth gate, Home/Ask/About navigation, question list + detail, anonymous option UI, warm theme, moderator answer form) appears implemented, but some key requirements are incomplete: questions lack title/details separation, answers are limited to a single answer per question, and anonymous questions do not retain author principal for audit as required.",

      "requirement": "The backend still stores the author principal for moderation/audit, but the UI respects anonymity settings.",
